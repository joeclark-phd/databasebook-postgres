# Tutorial databases

I'll use a set of recurring examples throughout the chapters of this book, to illustrate concepts in business contexts that make sense to readers, and maybe to also add a "reality check" so I don't end up creating wildly artificial examples.  I've even come up with silly names for them:

- **AUCTagon**: A database for an online-auction application like eBay, to keep track of users (buyers and sellers), product listings organized in categories and subcategories, bids and auction results, feedback and more.  We'll build up parts of AUCTagon in each chapter.
- **WebuLATER**: A database back-end for a social network application, WebuLATER will allow us to illustrate some other concepts that don't make it into AUCTagon, including some "Web 2.0" features like network-traversing queries, tagging and commenting on everything, and more.  Parts of WebuLATER will be built in each chapter.

A couple of other tutorial databases will be introduced as homework assignments to provide interesting and relevant challenges for students.  I won't build the solutions in the book, but will provide them separately for instructors who wish to assign them in classes:

- **LESSONbinder**: A learning-management system that keeps track of students' course enrollments, assignments, grades, degree completion, and so on.  You probably use one of these at your university.  My solutions will be provided in a separate instructor's manual.
- **PalletTABLE**: A database for a manufacturing ERP system, PalletTABLE stores bills of materials, production plans, and inventory data, and can be used to analyze work in progress, throughput, and the value stream.  Intended to be a more challenging example, my solutions will be provided separately for instructors or self-guided learners.  You're advised to try it yourself before looking at my solution!
