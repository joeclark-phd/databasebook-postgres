He was one of the first generation of Web developers in the 1990s, and has been fascinated with databases and data modeling since he first learned how relational databases could power dynamic websites, around 1999.  His academic interests lately have been at the intersection of data analytics and entrepreneurship, and new types of workflows such as Agile, Lean, and Design Thinking.  His most ambitious project yet is raising four children with his beautiful wife, Xiaofang.
